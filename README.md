This repository contains the HTML code for a digital invitation to a seminar on Digital Marketing organized by WireUp Technologies Pvt. Ltd. The seminar is designed to introduce participants to digital marketing, strategies, and effective tools.

- Event schedule with detailed session information.

## Learning Outcomes

Creating this digital invitation page helped in understanding the following:

1. **HTML Structuring**:
   - How to structure a webpage using HTML elements such as headings (`<h1>` to `<h4>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), and lists (`<ul>`, `<li>`).
   - Using tables (`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`) to display structured data.

2. **Form Handling**:
   - Creating a form using the `<form>` tag with various input types (`text`, `number`, `email`, `checkbox`).
   - Labeling form elements using the `<label>` tag for better accessibility.

3. **Embedding Content**:
   - Embedding Google Maps using the `<iframe>` tag to show the location of the event.
   - Including images (`<img>`) to enhance visual appeal.

4. **Centering Content**:
   - Using the `<center>` tag to align content in the center of the page (though it's deprecated in modern HTML, it's still useful for understanding basic alignment).

5. **Styling**:
   - Basic inline styling to improve the appearance of the page elements.
